A C++ memory management simulator that models how an operating system allocates and frees memory. It simulates contiguous physical memory, supports First Fit, Best Fit, and Worst Fit allocation strategies, performs block splitting and coalescing, and reports fragmentation and memory utilization through an interactive CLI.
